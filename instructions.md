## Omniverse DAO and Omni Wars website

Inspiration: [LayerZero website](https://layerzero.network/)

The main purpose of this website is to provide basic information about the project, team, roadmap, products and an interface for minting NFT collections.

The general design of the dapp should be dark-mode first, completed in monochrome tones with appropriate colors being used for highlighting different blockchains and factions.

General:
* User should stay logged-in as long as the browser session is active.

Screens:
* Omniverse: vision, roadmap, team and links subsections. Homepage of the website.

Miscellaneous:
* favicon.ico should be changed to omniversedao.ico, an .ico version of the omniverse DAO logo
